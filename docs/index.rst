``epistasis`` documentation
===========================

A Python API for modeling statistical, high-order epistasis in genotype-phenotype maps.
This library provides modules to:

    1. Decompose genotype-phenotype maps into high-order epistatic interactions
    2. Find nonlinear scales in the genotype-phenotype map
    3. Calculate the contributions of different epistatic orders and
    4. Estimate the uncertainty in the epistatic coefficients and

For more information about the epistasis models in this library, see our Genetics paper:

This library is built on top of well known tools in the scientific Python stack. 
It uses packages like matplotlib, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and pandas. We strive
to make the interface follow the norms defined by these tools. If you think of ways
to improve our API, please open an issue on Github! We'd love to hear your feedback.

Currently, this package works only as an API. There is no command-line
interface. Instead, we encourage you use this package inside `Jupyter notebooks`_ .

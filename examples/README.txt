===============

Some tutorials for this package are included in Jupyter (formerly IPython) Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks and the IPython kernel are dependencies for viewing these notebooks interactively. If you'd like to just view a static representation of these notebooks, use NBViewer.

The notebooks are also hosted on [mybinder.org]() if you would like to try the
package using temporary notebooks. No installation is required.
